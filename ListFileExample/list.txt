*  DVD List file.  The filename of this file must match the environment variable DVDLISTFILE
*  That variable default value is 'list.txt'
*  The order of the files in this list is the order in which the files will be played when 
*  stepping through files with the PlayVideo system. The last file wraps around to the first 
*  file in both direction.
*
*  An asterisk mark '*' at the start of a line indicates a comment. Empty lines are ignored.
*  The asterisk can be used to comment out a file name. This will prevent a file from playing, 
*  but keep the file in the list for future use.
*
*  The first flash drive must be named VIDEOS and have this list.txt file in its root directory.
*  Flash drives can be added as VIDEOS2, VIDEOS3 and VIDEOS4, if desired. If using more than one
*  flash drive, change which flash drive to read next by using the at mark '@' in front of the flash 
*  drive name. See the example below. It jumps back and forth between flash drives. If every file is 
*  on VIDEOS, the @ mark is not needed.
*
*  To make a video file repeat (loop) using the at mark '@' in front of a video file name. Note, 
*  this has nothing to do with changing flash drives. 
*  Each line identifying a video file must start with a negative sign and the volume number (in decibels). 
*  The volume number is actually an attenuation value. See the installation document file for further details. 
*  This file and the video file names must be in the same directory.
*
*  There are two special commands:
*
*  MIN_PLAY_TIME
*  When the player is advanced to the next video, that video will play for MIN_PLAY_TIME seconds before 
*  the player can be advanced again. Example:
*  $MIN_PLAY_TIME=60
*  This command will assure that a video will play for at least 60 seconds before the forward or reverse 
*  button will be recognized again.
*
*  AUTO_ADVANCE
*  When the AUTO_ADVANCE commend is set to YES or TRUE, the player will advance to the next video in the 
*  list when a video ends. Example:
*  $AUTO_ADVANCE=YES
