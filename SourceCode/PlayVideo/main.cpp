// main.cpp of PlayVideo program
//
//  Single or double pushbutton-based video jukebox player for individuals with disabilities.
//  A. Mitz 2017.  This is the 2nd generator version of software developed for D. Mitz. The original
//  is called FreedomDVD and was developed for Windows XP.  This version is designed for a Raspberry
//  Pi 3 running Raspbian, a Debian Linux variant.
//
//  Updated 1/25/2022 by J. Mitz.
//  Functions have been added to allow the system to automatically reboot a defined number of times if
//  the system is unable to locate the list file.
//  This will unmount and remount drives, fixing list file drive path issues automatically.
//
//  PlayVideo assumes there is a flash drive of size 64 MB formatted at FAT32 plugged into
//  one of the USB sockets. A SD or microSD card formatted as FAT32 will also work if USB adapter is used.
//  The USB drive must have .MP4 (or other) video files on the root directory along with a special
//  text file called list.txt. The text file must have an ordered DVD file name list that determines
//  the order in which videos can be selected.  Each entry in that file starts with a volume value
//  (positive or negative) that is the gain parameter in decibels. The gain value is followed by
//  spaces or tabs then the video file name.
//
//  If the first character of a line is '*', that line is treated as a comment. Blank lines are ignored.
//  If the first character of a line is '@', that line redefines the directory of the subsequent video files.
//  The @ is used when video files are spread across multiple flash drives.  The normal naming scheme is this:
//  VIDEOS   name of the main flash drive with list.txt.
//  VIDEOS1  first "extra" flash drive
//  VIDEOS2  second extra flash drive
//  ... VIDEOS9  more extra flash drives
//  Currently, VIDEOS, VIDEOS1, VIDEOS2, VIDEOS3 are hard-coded in ShutDown
//  The main flash drive will get automounted at:  /media/pi/VIDEOS
//  The assumption is that other flash drives will be mounted on the same mount directory (e.g., /media/pi/VIDEOS2 )
//  The actual requirements are:
//     DVD list file can be found using the environment variable DVDLISTFILE
//     The videos for the main flash drive are on the same directory as the list file (i.e., root directory of flash drive)
//     The name for each extra flash drive ends with a numeric (0 to 9) and is on the same subdirectory as the main flash drive
//     The videos for each extra flash drive are on the root directory of the flash drive
//  Note that there is only one list file.  See the example list files.
//  Note, this scheme requires the flash drives to have names.
//  Example list file:
//  * Example list file  /media/pi/VIDEOS/list.txt   (on USB drive called VIDEOS)
//  *volume  file-name  volume value range -6000 to 0  (no positive values)
//  -0       Eagles Hell Freezes Over.mp4
//  * This file name is prepended with @ sign.  It runs in loop mode (restarts when finished).
//  -0       @Cat Stevens Majikat.mp4
//  -400     Garth Brooks NYC.mp4
//  -1000    George Benson Live.mp4
//  * The next two videos are found on the second USB drive
//  @VIDEOS2
//  -0       The Police Synchronicity.mp4
//  -0       Sheryl Crow Rockin The Globe.mp4
//  * This file determines the play order and we can go back to the first USB drive, if desired
//  @VIDEOS
//  -600     Bonnie Raitt.mp4
//
//  As just discussed, the location of the list.txt file is defined in the environment variable DVDLISTFILE (see below).
//  The automatic mount of Raspbian will mount this under the user's name under the /media directory.  Since the [default]
//  user name is "pi", a USB drive named VIDEOS will be mounted at: /media/pi/VIDEOS.
//
//  PlayVideo assumes its name is "PlayVideo". That name is hard-coded when it makes sure only one instance is running.
//
//  These environment variables are set in the system file /etc/profile.
//  DVDLISTFILE="/media/pi/VIDEOS/list.txt"      full path of list file. DVD video files must be in same directory
//  DVDPLAYER="/usr/bin/omxplayer"         full path of video player. Note, only omxplayer supports hardware decoding
//  DVDPLAYEROPTIONS="--adev hdmi"     play audio through the hdmi device
//                   "--adev local"    play audio through the Raspberry Pi speaker jack
//                   "--adev both"     play audio through both
//            Other options can be included, like:  --win \"100 100 450 450\"   small video window on the desktop
//
//  Two pushbuttons are supported, one to step forward and one backward through the list of file names.
//  These buttons connect to general purpose I/O (GPIO) pins and use the WiringPi utilities
//  (http://wiringpi.com/).  Buttons trigger interrupts.  Software debounces the buttons.
//  Mechanical buttons work as do wireless keyfob buttons.  Normal debounce time can be changed
//  to a longer duration by jumpering GPIO header pins 19 and 20.
//
//  Default configuration is to play audio through both the Raspberry Pi audio port itself, and through the HDMI device
//  by including "--adev both" in the DVDPLAYEROPTIONS string. Placing a jumper between pins 25 and 26 on the GPIO header
//  with modify the options string, replacing "--adev both" with "--adev local".  This provides a simple way to disable
//  HDMI audio without requiring Linux expertise.
//
//  Coding was done with Code Blocks IDE and a relatively generic port of the gcc compiler. Currently, Code Blocks can
//  be installed using the Raspbian software manager.  WiringPi utilities appear to come with the standard installation.
//  However, you will need to add /usr/lib/libwiringPi.so and /usr/lib/libwiringPiDev.so to the link options.
//  The C++ port seems to support C99 rather than C11.
//
//  The PlayVideo program is not called directly at boot time.  For various reasons, it is easiest to
//  startup at boot time after loading an instance of the lxterminal program.
//  Put StartVideo.sh in the pi home directory and make it executable
//    #!/bin/bash
//    killall -q omxplayer.bin
//    sleep 1
//    killall -q PlayVideo
//    sleep 2
//    PlayVideo
//
//  Start the StartVideo.sh script by placing it at the end of: /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
//     @lxterminal -e /home/pi/StartVideos.sh
//
//  Shutdown button: See the program ShutDown.
//
//  v 0.1  10 July 2017  Initial version working.
//  v 0.2  11 July 2017  Get location and name of list file from the environment variable  DVDLISTFILE
//  v 0.3  12 July 2017  Support for pulsed button inputs.  Added environment variable DVDPLAYER
//  v 0.4  13 July 2017  Support for Shutdown button.
//  v 0.5  16 July 2017  Support for comments in list file. Added environment variable DVDPLAYEROPTIONS
//  v 0.6  20 July 2017  Detect if this is the only copy of PlayVideo that is running
//  v 0.7  23 July 2017  Process pushbuttons the same as pulsed pushbuttons. Make more tolerant to list file errors.
//  v 0.8  23 July 2017  Mechanical pushbuttons given longer bounce time.
//  v 0.9  28 July 2017  Raised switch debounce time to 120 ms. Fixed bug in ListManager that was not counting the numbers
//                       of videos correctly or the wrap-around correctly.  Removed some unused code.
//  v 1.0  28 July 2017  Sometimes the USB flash drive does not repond to an open file request.  Try to open the list
//                       file 3 times before giving up.
//  v 1.1  11 Aug  2017  New program called ShutDown runs in Linux in the background.  That makes the Shutdown function of
//                       this program unnecessary. It has been disabled here.   New jumper option disables audio via HDMI port.
//                       IO pins remapped for easier cabling.
//  v 1.2  27 Aug 2017   ListManager now supports videos spread across multiple flash drives. Other classes changed to accomodate.
//  v 1.3  16 Sep 2017   The previous child process is not always getting killed.  This causes two videos to play simultaneously.
//                       New variable KILL_WAIT_TIME for PlayVideo class controls the wait time after a killall command.
//                       Removed left-over shutdown button code.
//  v 1.4  16 Sep 2017   ExecuteCommand converted from c program to c++ object.
//  v 1.5   3 Oct 2017   SLOW_BOUNCETIME is now the default bounce time.  Increased to 800 ms.
//  v 1.6   4 Oct 2017   Holding down the FOWARD or REVERSE button now continuously steps through the videos.
//                       KILL_WAIT_TIME=500 to make sure previous video has stopped.  SLOW_BOUNCETIME is 2000 to give the user time
//                       to release the button before the next video starts.
//  v 1.7   4 Nov 2017   Prepend the file name with the @ sign to make that video loop indefinitely.
//  v 1.8   5 Nov 2017   Bug in PlayVideo caused files greater than 2.147 GB to not be found. (fopen() replaced with fopen64())
//  v 1.9   5 Nov 2017   ListManager now tries 6 times to open the list directory
//  v 2.1  25 Jan 2022   Added ListManager functions for automatic reboots
// please update the VERSION string with each new version.
